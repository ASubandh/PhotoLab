Despite having relatively easy DIP operations to implement, this project had its own set of difficulties that were different from Assignment 2. Most notably was the
decomposition of the program - it makes sense why that portion of the assignment is worth the most because it was quite novel for me. Of course I knew that large programs
are composed of multiple files but I didnt know how they interact with eachother until now, so it was a really good learning experience. Im not sure how the "clean" function
works in the makefile. Im also not sure why my DEBUG macro started working and then just suddenly decided to stop working even though I'm sure I didnt modify anything. 
Im certain that I implemented at least the AutoTest print statements correctly, even though I wasnt able to stop the PrintMenu() from printing in the Debug mode. 
If I had more time and were better with managing my workload, I would have attempted the MotionBlur function for sure.
